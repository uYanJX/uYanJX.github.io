<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
  👋 Greetings! Welcome to my homepage! I am ​**Jianxin Yan**, currently a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in ​**Information Security** at the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University](https://cse.whu.edu.cn/). I am expected to pursue a Master's degree in the ​**College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University** starting September 2025.  

  Since entering university, I have actively participated in various research projects and academic competitions. I've received several honors including the **National** Scholarship, **NSFOCUS** Scholarship, **Lei Jun** Computer Science Research Practice Fund, National Mathematical Modeling Competition (Second Prize), National Information Security Competition (Third Prize), Computer Design Competition (First Prize in Central South Region), and multiple provincial awards. 
  
  I've been involved in projects including but not limited to **Large Language Model efficiency optimization**, Recommendation Systems, and AI security.
